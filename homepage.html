    <p class="standardtext">Unfortunately I don't keep images of myself around, so instead here we have an image I had around instead. I'm Thomas, a near 30 year old nerd that has lived near Manchester their entire life. I've spent most my adult life helping others. Either through volunteer positions at local charities or purposely stepping away from work to help friends and family. As the need for these things have settled down in my life, I've started looking to what I want to do and it brought me here to CodeNation and to this course, and eventually this site.

    This site I made some weird decisions. The font I went with Arial. I decided this because it's a font that's good for readability for dyslexics, a matter that is near and dear to me. Without it, reading my own writing would have been painful and time consuming. For the colour scheme I've stuck mainly to monochrome and splashes of purple as that's the theme of my home. My partner likes to decorate everything in monochrome and I enforce purple additions.
