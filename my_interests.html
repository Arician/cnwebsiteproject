    <p class="standardtext">I dedicated an entire page to my gaming, but I wanted to share some of my other interests. I've become a bit of a delittante. Over the years I've at times been a hobbyist locksmith, picked up (and then lost) semi fluency in several languages, been an excercise nut and became a volenteer security guard for a local charity and much more. I've also found myself listening to a weird and wonderful array of music. This ranges anywhere from metal, rap or pop from all around the world to weird and wonderful niche genres like denpa or strange nearly <a href="https://youtu.be/UxM5UgpXYM4" target="_blank">songs</a> that are based on weird creepy stories from random internet message boards.

    It's also within these two things that I've found another weird hobby. Puns. Specifically puns that utlise multiple languages. My current favourite being the answer to "What do spiders taste like" which is "Suppai da" or "It's sour". This has also somewhat leaked into my love of music, where I have started finding songs based on puns. Below I have put a favourite of mine. It's based around the word ラブカ or rabuka. This is the Japanese word for a frilled shark but also how you would say "is it love?" using the Japanese way of trying to say the English word love. It's a pun that runs the entire course of the song, both in terms of the actual pun being frequent but the dual meaning of the rest of the lyrics.
