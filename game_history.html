    <h1 class="stroke gameheader">My history of gaming</h1>
    <p class="stroke gametext">I was pretty much raised playing games. From a young age I was playing games on the Sega Megadrive and Super Nintendo, playing Final Fantasy Legends and eventually Pokemon on the Gameboy. Later in life I'd do all I could to play more games, both more modern but also going back to play games on consoles and computers from long before I was born.
        <br><br>
        As I grew older, my dads side of the family grew a strong sense of friendly competition and playing together. My mums side of the family grew a big sense of playing and learning alone and then unfriendly competition. Weirdly these two things lead me to fighting games. Despite having played, competed with, enjoyed and loved countless different and sometimes bizzarre genres, if I had to pick one it'd be fighting games.
        <br><br>
    That genre itself has lead me through a journey of games. From my childhood of Strret Fighter 2, Tekken and the controversial Mortal Kombat. Through to my teen years of Marvel vs Capcom, Street fighter 3 and 4, more Tekken. Then finally to my adulthood of Guilty Gear, Blazblue, Melty Blood and most importantly <abbr title="Under Night In Birth: EXE [CL-R]">UNICLR</abbr>. Games that have I've poured hours into learning tricks for, that have tested my own ability to grow and overcome my shortcomings through disabilities, all to just play with friends.
    <br><br>
    This is why I wanted to dedicate a page to probably my biggest hobby. It's one of the few things I did with both my parents. Something that shaped my other hobbies. Something that dragged me into tech and nerd culture. Something that shaped my friendships and even now I spend my idle time playing games with my partner.
